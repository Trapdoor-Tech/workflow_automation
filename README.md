# Notion Page Creator with OpenAI GPT

This Python script creates a new page on Notion with content generated by interacting with OpenAI's GPT model. The script can be used to create educational content or any other type of content that can be generated using OpenAI's GPT.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A Notion account with API access
- An OpenAI account with API access

## Dependencies

- httpx
- openai
- notion_client

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install httpx openai notion_client
```

## Environment Variables

Before running the script, you need to set the following environment variables:

- `NOTION_API_KEY`: Your Notion API key.
- `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID`: The ID of the parent page under which the new page will be created.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OPENAI API key. 

For example, on Linux/Mac:

```sh
export NOTION_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
export NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=your-parent-page-id-here
export OPENAI_API_KEY=you-api-key-here
```

And on Windows (Command Prompt):

```sh
set NOTION_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
set NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID=your-parent-page-id-here
set OPENAI_API_KEY=you-api-key-here
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yqwCrypto/workflow_automation.git
cd workflow_automation
```

2. Run the script:

```sh
python automatic.py
```

2. The script defines a prompt and a system prompt to interact with OpenAI's GPT model.
3. It sends a request to OpenAI's GPT model to generate content based on the prompts.
4. The script then creates a new page on Notion under a parent page and populates it with the content generated by GPT.
